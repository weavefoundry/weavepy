//! The process allocator: mimalloc, entered through its plain allocation
//! functions whenever they already satisfy the requested alignment.
//!
//! Every mimalloc block is at least word aligned, and every block of 16
//! bytes or more is 16-byte aligned (`MI_MAX_ALIGN_SIZE`), so a layout
//! aligned to that much needs no aligned entry point. The aligned entry points
//! take their fast path only when the size class's free list happens to
//! offer a suitably aligned block, and otherwise fall to a generic path
//! that may over-allocate. Rust asks for alignment on every allocation,
//! so going through them would put every allocation on that path.
